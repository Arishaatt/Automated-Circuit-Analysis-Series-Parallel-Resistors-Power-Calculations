# Automated Circuit Analysis: Series–Parallel Resistors & Power Calculations
This repository contains a Python script that performs automated analysis of a mixed resistive network (series–parallel).  
This program calculates equivalent resistance, branch currents, voltage drops across each component, and total power delivered by the source.
